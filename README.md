* [Evidence: subnet_audit.txt](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/subnet_audit.txt)
* **Explanation:** Connectivity verification. Leveraged ip addr and ping in Termux to blueprint subnetting architectures and ensure routing integrity. (Target: 192.168.1.200)

### 🛠️ T1-M1-S06: Protocol Interrogation (Wireshark Analysis)
* [Evidence: protocol_audit.txt](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/protocol_audit.txt)
* **Explanation:** Protocol parsing via grep, awk, and sed in Termux. Utilized raw data captures to isolate network protocol anomalies and transform traffic into threat intelligence. (Google IP: 142.250.217.14)

### 🛰️ T1-M2.TLAB: Operation Blackout (Linux Hardening)
* [Evidence: harden.sh](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/harden.sh)
* **Explanation:** Initialization of Module 2 Capstone. Leveraging Google Cloud Shell via Chrome Mobile for high-compute security assessments and advanced automation workflows using the Note 20 Ultra.

## 🐍 T1-M1.S07: THE AUTOMATION FORGE (Network Reconnaissance)

| Data Point | Desktop/Laptop User (Standard) | Android Cyber Workbench (Note 20 Ultra) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Standard x86/x64 Linux Desktop | ARM64 Mobile Sandbox (Termux) |
| **Evidence & Data** | Automated Script Execution | 1. [Evidence 1: port_check.py](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/port_check.py) <br> 2. [Evidence 2: s07reflection.md](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/s07reflection.md) |

**🛡️ S07 Technical Analysis:** In this session, the Python-based socket logic was executed within the ARM64 Termux environment. The scan proved mobile-driven reconnaissance is viable in enterprise network topologies without requiring native root permissions, yielding a successful asset map of the environment.

## 🛡️ T1-M1.S08: REFINED PAPER TRAIL (Forensic Audit Comparison)

| Data Point | Desktop User (Standard) | Android Cyber Workbench (Note 20 Ultra) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source Data** | Static `auth_audit.log` file | Live `ps aux` Memory Snapshot |
| **Evidence & Data** | IPs: 10.0.0.55 / 172.16.0.5 | 1. [Evidence 1: brute_report.txt](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/brute_report.txt) (Data: 10.0.0.55 / 172.16.0.5) <br> 2. [Evidence 2: monitoring_log.txt](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/monitoring_log.txt) (Timestamp: Tue Mar 24 23:57:04 EDT 2026) |

**🛡️ S08 Technical Analysis:** The forensic task was performed by capturing a live memory snapshot via `ps aux`. The data was manually filtered using `grep` to isolate PID 3845. The system successfully extracted target IPs (10.0.0.55 and 172.16.0.5) from active system noise, demonstrating the extraction of forensic evidence in a live mobile environment.

## 🚀 T1-M1.S09: THE AUTOMATION PIVOT (Engineering Audit Comparison)

| Data Point | Desktop User (Standard) | Android Cyber Workbench (Note 20 Ultra) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provisioning** | `sudo bash` (Success) | No superuser binary detected (Blocked by Android Security) |
| **Evidence & Data** | {"severity": "High"} (Automatic) | 1. [Evidence 1: audit_brief.txt](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/lab_prep/audit_brief.txt) (Data: Cryptominer JSON Seed) <br> 2. [Evidence 2: system_auditor.py](https://github.com/CK-Bachoo/IF-Cyber-Portfolio/blob/main/system_auditor.py) (Logic Verification) |
| **Audit Result** | Malware Detected via Root Access | [Result: [-] Clean / System Secured] |

**🛡️ S09 Technical Analysis:** During this audit, the Android security model (Samsung Knox) actively blocked the `sudo` command required for the malware to provision itself. A custom Python auditor parsed JSON threat seeds manually to prove detection accuracy against known signatures. The final audit resulted in a Clean report, proving the OS remained uncompromised.
